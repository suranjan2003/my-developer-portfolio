		description:
			"Developed an end-to-end AI-driven voice analysis platform for healthcare RCM call auditing and agent assistance. The system includes a React + Tailwind dashboard, real-time audio transcription using Groq Whisper, automated core-audit scoring, denial scenario detection, coaching insights, and risk alerts. Built a FastAPI backend with REST + WebSocket support, MongoDB-based dynamic prompt management, auto-analysis mode for periodic folder scanning, and detailed structured reporting. Also implemented a real-time Agent Assist module that streams transcripts, detects payer denial patterns through rule-based logic, and generates 3–5 AI resolution prompts per scenario.",

		description:
			"I developed a full-stack fest management platform for the Industrial and Systems Engineering Department at IIT Kharagpur. The website was built using the MERN stack and deployed on Microsoft Azure, serving over 28,000 visitors. I implemented secure JWT-based authentication with bcrypt and middleware, enabling verified access for 700+ registered users. Additionally, I built a scalable Admin Portal using Node.js and MongoDB to offer real-time data management, event oversight, and role-based accessibility for organizers.",

			"I worked as a Frontend Development Intern at Emiant Innovations Pvt Ltd, where I contributed to refining their official website and developing an intelligent recruitment platform. I upgraded the Emiant official website (10,000+ annual viewers) using Embedded JS and enhanced the UI with Canva-based design elements. Additionally, I built a Talent Acquisition Management (TAM) Portal using the MERN stack, integrating a JavaScript-driven intelligent filtration system that reduced the hiring cycle time by 30%.",

		description:
			"I developed a profit-maximizing linear optimization model for efficient cargo distribution across multiple compartments as part of the Operations Research Lab course project. The model was formulated and implemented using the Optimization Programming Language (OPL) in IBM CPLEX Optimization Studio. I encoded realistic weight–volume capacity constraints to ensure feasible allocation while preventing overload or mismatch errors. The optimized solution was further tested using Arena simulation, resulting in a 35% improvement in profitability compared to the baseline setup.",
